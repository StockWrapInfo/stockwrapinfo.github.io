              <h5 class="text-danger"> Custom Wish Lists - The kind of customized list that you always wanted for your successful marketing campaigns </h5>
              <p style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;"> Not everybody has the same wish, then how can we deliver the same list to every customer. This is the reason why Trimaax Data came up with Custom Wish Lists as part of our lead generation services. This is one of the highlights of our services.</p>
              <h5 class="text-danger"> Custom Wish Lists Is: </h5>
              <ul style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">
                <li> The kind of list you have always dreamt of using. </li>
                <li> A list which will certainly bring you more revenues. </li>
                <li> A list which resembles no other list. </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin:30px;"> If you are planning to conduct a marketing campaign for a specific audience, then your list needs to be custom made with considerably high precision. But unfortunately, most list sellers in the industry take no trouble of listening to your specific requirements before delivering the final list.</p>
              <p style="margin:30px;"> Using the power of our 800-expert telemarketing and data team, you can start with some basic file information and leverage identification of the records you need. For example, as part of our data management services, we had a customer who wanted a list of the top 10,000 bloggers, and another who wanted to know how many elevators were in each building in New York City. You cannot find that type of information in the open market. Our lists are just as unique as your requirements.</p><br>

            <p style="margin:30px;"> Reaching out to people is easy. But reaching out to the right people with the right message is not. In this digital world, you cannot do without broadcasting to your customers, and whatâ€™s a better way than emailing! </p>
            <p style="margin:30px;"> Possessing the right data and not using it to generate quality leads is equivalent to having no data. Using your data to generate interest and awareness, along with generating leads, is what you should intend to do with your database. </p>
            <p style="margin:30px;"> With tight budgets and limited resources in marketing departments, reaching out becomes difficult.

It will not only create content and HTML codes for you, but will also deliver email campaigns to your targeted audience by selecting recipients from our master database. </p>
